<!--
  Do it again, please, but all of it.

  Add the fundamental five to this file.
  They are: doctype, html, head, title, body.

  Then, make the title of the document "Problem 003"
  (without the quotation marks)

  Put a lang="en" attribute on the html tag
-->
<!doctype html>                   <!-- solution -->
<html lang="en">                  <!-- solution -->
  <head>                          <!-- solution -->
    <title>Problem 003</title>    <!-- solution -->
  </head>                         <!-- solution -->
  <body>                          <!-- solution -->
  </body>                         <!-- solution -->
</html>                           <!-- solution -->
