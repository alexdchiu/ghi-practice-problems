      In this one, we're constructing a table. Pay
      attention to all of it because pieces will
      disappear over the next couple of problems.

      Where'd it all go?

      This context has a list of Person objects stored
      in the "people" key.

    <table>
      <!-- Just the whole table head, here -->

      <!--
        The whole tbody, for loop, tr, and td tags to show
        each person's name, age, and pronouns.
